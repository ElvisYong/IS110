For example, consider the following scenario: We want to prompt the user for an even number between 2 and 100 (both inclusive). We need to keep prompting the user until the user enters a valid number. How do we formulate the `bool` expression inside the `while` statement for this scenario?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that it may <b>not be easy</b> the specify <b>the condition under which we need to re-prompt the user</b>, i.e., the condition under which the input is <b>invalid</b>. On the other hand, it is <b>easier</b> to formulate <b>the condition under which the input is valid</b>. Let `num` represent the input number from the user. The condition under which `num` is considered valid is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    num >= 2 and num <= 100 and num % 2 == 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "So when we write our `while`-loop to check whether we need to re-prompt the user, we need to check whether the complex condition above is <b>not</b> `True`, i.e., whether the condition above is `False`. When the entire condition above is `False`, we need to re-prompt the user.\n",
